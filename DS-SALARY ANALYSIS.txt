** Finding Total number of persons in the dataset.

SELECT count(*) FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries;

** Finding which company size has highest number of people in the dataset.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries WHERE company_size = "L";

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries WHERE company_size = "M";

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries WHERE company_size = "S";

Conclusion: Comparing the above 3 values and we will come to the conclusion.


** Find maximum salary of data science employees from the table.

SELECT MAX(salary_in_usd) FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries;


** Find minimum salary of data science employees from the table.

--SELECT MIN(salary_in_usd) FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries;


** Find average salary of data science employees from the table.

--SELECT avg(salary_in_usd) FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries;

** Find sum of all salary of data science employees from the table.
--SELECT avg(salary_in_usd) FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries;

** Find distinct number of job titles from the table.
--SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT job_title) as "Number of Job Titles" FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries;

** Find number of employment types in the table
--SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT employment_type) as "Number of Employment Types" FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries;

** Find number of experience levels in the table.
--SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT experience_level) as "Number of Experience Levels" FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries;

** Find number of types of salary_currency from the table.
-- SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary_currency) as "Different Salary Currencies" FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries;

** Find Sum of Salary from the experience level SE.

-- SELECT SUM(salary) FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries WHERE experience_level = "SE";

Similarly, if asked we can find salary for other experience levels too and apply other aggregate functions too like AVG(), MAX(), MIN() to them.

--Using Logical Operators:

**Find sum of salary of employees working in the year 2020 and with experience_level ="MI"

--SELECT SUM(salary) FROM datascience_salaries.ds_salaries WHERE work_year = 2020 AND experience_level= "SE";
